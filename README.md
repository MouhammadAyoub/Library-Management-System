## Description

Desktop application built with ***JavaFX*** and ***MySQL*** designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps the librarian to maintain the database of new books and borrowed books along with their due dates. It tracks the records of the number of books in the library, how many books are issued, how many books have been returned or renewed.

## Installation

Download the project from github to your desktop:

  - **With Git** :
      If youâ€™re familiar with git and have it installed on your computer, you can clone the repository to download the files.
      
      **1.** Click the green button labeled &nbsp;`Code`</br>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="assets/images/Button-Position.png" width="300px;" /></br>
      
      **2.** Copy the URL of the repository</br>
      
      **3.** Next, on your local machine, open your bash shell and change your current working directory to the location where you would like to clone your repository
      ```shell
      cd "path-to-your-folder"
      ```
      
      **4.** Once you have navigated to the directory where you want to put your repository, you can use
      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/MouhammadAyoub/Library-Management-System.git
      ```
      
      **5.** When you run `git clone https://github.com/MouhammadAyoub/Library-Management-System.git`, You should see output like
      ```shell
      Cloning into 'test-repo'...
      remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
      remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
      remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
      Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), done.
      Checking connectivity... done.
      ```
      </br>
      
  - **Without Git** :
      When downloading materials to your laptop, it is easiest to download the entire repository.
      
      **1.** Click on the green `Code` button, then download the repository as a ZIP file</br>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="assets/images/Download-Zip.png" width="350px" /></br>
      
      **2.** Find the downloaded .zip file on your computer, likely in your Downloads folder</br>
      
      **3.** Unzip it, this will create a folder named after the GitHub repository</br></br>

  - **Steps you must do to make the app work properly** :
      
      **1.** Launch ***MySQL Workbench*** and create a database named `librarydb`</br>
      
      **2.** Run the content of `library.sql` file in the database you just created in order to create all the database tables</br>
      
      **3.** Change the ***url***, ***user*** and ***password*** of database connection in the `Database.java` file</br>
